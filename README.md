# About Simple Stopwatch
Simple Stopwatch is a small application for timing anything on your computer. I have made this open-source as I would like people to help on this project and add new features.

The goal is to create a functional stopwatch which is feature-rich and lightweight (uses minimum CPU and RAM possible).
